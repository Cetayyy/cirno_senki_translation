This ice fairy busted the vanguard... Looks like she has considerable powers...
We'd better not underestimage her because she is a fairy.
*RHT 文 不敵
So... Let's prevent her from progressing by distracting her a little...

*RHT 文 笑
Hey, Miss ice fairy over there. Do you have a moment ?

*SND おてんば恋娘

*LHT チルノ
Hm ? What ? You want something from me ?

*RHT 文 笑
No, it's nothing much. You look so strong, so... I wanted to talk to you a little.

*LHT チルノ 笑
Hehehe ! That's 'cause I'm the strongest !
*LHT チルノ
So, what is it ?

*RHT 文
Well, since you're so strong, I wanted to ask you for help in solving a mystery.
*RHT 文 哀
It's a mystery that has been passed among us tengus for generations, but no one ever solved it.
*RHT 文 笑
So, if you really are the strongest, you should be able to solve it... Right ?

*LHT チルノ 哀
A mystery ?

*RHT 文 哀
Hmm... Looks like you can't solve it either, huh. I guess you're not the strongest after all...

*LHT チルノ 怒
Whaaat !? Of course I am ! I can solve the toughest of mysteries too !

*RHT 文 笑
Oh ! That's reassuring ! Well then, shall we start ? Listen well...
*RHT 文
"Ice is ice, but there is ice that is sweet and not cold. What is this ?"
Do you know the answer, Miss strongest fairy ?

*LHT チルノ 笑
Eh ? That's easy ! Tengus are stupid for not knowing that.

*RHT 文 驚
Oh ? So you know the answer ?

*LHT チルノ 笑
Of course ! If you say sweet ice, it's shaved ice !!

*RHT 文 驚
...
*RHT 文
Isn't shaved ice cold ?

*LHT チルノ 哀
You said "sweet ice", so that's the only option, right ?

*RHT 文 哀
I said "An ice that is sweet and not cold" though.
*RHT 文
So shaved ice isn't the correct answer.

*LHT チルノ 哀
Then, melted shaved ice ?

*RHT 文 哀
Is that still ice ?

*LHT チルノ 怒
What !? There's no such thing as ice that isn't cold ! What is this !?

*RHT 文
What if I tell you that it really is a thing ?

*LHT チルノ 苦
Ugh.. That can't exist... That can't...

*RHT 文 哀
Even though you're the strongest fairy, it seems you don't know the answer after all, huh.
*RHT 文 不敵
I was expecting a little more from you since it was about ice...

*LHT チルノ 苦
Ugh... it's ice, and yet... It's not cold... But ice is cold...
Grr... I don't believe it... My head's dizzy...
*LHT チルノ 怒
Grrr !! What is the answer !!?

*RHT 文 驚
My my... She began to vent her anger on others because she can't endure the absurdity...
*RHT 文 不敵
It looks like it has more effect than just stopping her.
*RHT 文
By the way, the correct answer was "rock candy."
*RHT 文 哀
Yep, something definitely got lost in translation.
