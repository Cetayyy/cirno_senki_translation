Greetings, I've got something to report !
Yuuka Kazami, as well as fairies and youkais, are invading our territory and are coming towards us !
They are closing in on the restricted area !

*RHT 天狗紫
Guh...! Yuuka Kazami, why are you...? What is your purpose...!?
But it's not the moment to say such a thing. We have to intercept the ambush, quick !
Request everyone to dispatch ! We must repel them no matter what !!

Now that the administration has just changed, everyone pay attention to the Great Tengu...
We absolutely need to prevent any damage to the village...

It's kind of noisy here... What are they talking about ?

*RHT 文
Oh, Hatate. You came just at the right moment.

*LHT はたて 哀
At the right moment...? When you say that to me, I have a bad feeling about it...

*RHT 文 笑
You are free right now, right ? Can you give me a hand for a bit ?

*LHT はたて 怒
Ah ? For what ?

*RHT 文 哀
What will you say if I tell you that the village is attacked ?
*RHT 文 笑
There's no way you would just say "That doesn't matter to me", right ?

*LHT はたて 怒
R-Really !? Why didn't you tell me that right away ?

*RHT 文 哀
Don't scream at me like that...

*LHT はたて 怒
Then, would YOU understand even without the explanations ?

*RHT 文 笑
No. What are you talking about ? I don't understand such a thing.

*LHT はたて 怒
Then don't ask me for something unreasonable !

*RHT 文 哀
You're really noisy, are you ? You should only answer "Got it" without thinking about anything.
You're only allowed to answer either "Got it", "Understood", or "It can't be helped" !

*LHT はたて 怒
Those are all the same !

*RHT 文 笑
They have slightly different meanings. Should I explain them to you one by one ?

*LHT はたて 怒
You don't need to !

*RHT 文
Anyway. We should stop loitering and go quickly.
It seems the intruders will come soon.

*LHT はたて 哀
Sigh... It seems like the quarrel settled down, so I went to the village thinking it would be ok...
Geez, why do I get involved into these troublesome things every time ?

*RHT 文 笑
You sure are lucky !

*LHT はたて 怒
S-Shut up, you pestilence ! It's your fault most of the time !
*LHT はたて
Grr, let's go and finish this quickly !

*RHT 文 哀
We could have sped things up from the beginning...

*LHT はたて 怒
Should I hit you in the end ?
