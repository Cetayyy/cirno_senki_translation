Eh ? Wait, what is this !?

*RHT リグル 驚
I didn't know she has such power...
*RHT リグル 哀
I wonder if it's her trump card she only uses when necessary.

*LHT 大妖精 哀
W-Why haven't we see her do that yet ?

*RHT リグル
Maybe because she usually isn't pushed in a corner like that since she only fights us... ?

*LHT ミスティア 哀
... I feel like that she just did this on a whim.

*RHT リグル 哀
M-Maybe...

*LHT チルノ 笑
It doesn't matter !
*LHT チルノ
It's now an even fight, so we can go all out !
*LHT チルノ 笑
I'm coming, Rumia !

*RHT ルーミア 笑
Yay ! Let's plaaay !!
