*RHT 文 怒
Looks like they haven't done too much damage yet. Cirno, let's go !

*LHT キスメ 驚
Oh, right. The goal is to... Protect the Human Village !?
*LHT キスメ 怒
You guys didn't tell me this was the plan...!

*RHT 文 哀
(Oh... It looks like these ones had some trouble with the humans...)
...I understand how you feel.
*RHT 文
But you can use this occasion to show the humans how dangerous you are.

*LHT ヤマメ 怒
Mmmh... But we're still helping them...

*RHT 文
Please. You can help us AND keep the humans away from you. We both win here.

*LHT リグル
I agree. Let's show off our power !

*RHT パルスィ
...Welp, I guess we can't help it. No point in complaining here.
As a way to replay Cirno and her friends, I'll give you a hand.

*LHT キスメ 怒

*LHT キスメ
...Ok. But just this once.

It's decided, then. Let's go !
Cirno, please !

Alright ! Well then... Chaaarge !!!
