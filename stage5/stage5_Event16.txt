*LHT 幽香 哀
Good grief, what an unpleasant feeling to not being able to move the way you want.

*RHT 青娥 驚
Huh...? My amulet... It's been broken...?

*LHT 幽香 笑
Well, that was a pleasant experience. I feel like my body has become lighter, somehow.
I thank you for this.

*RHT 青娥 笑
Ah... Ahahaha... This is what matters the most. Now then...

*LHT 幽香 笑
Oh, wait a second.

*RHT 青娥 哀
U-Uh... I need to go have a word with the celestial over there...

*LHT 幽香 邪悪
But I haven’t showed my gratitude... yet.

*RHT 青娥 笑
O-Oh. That wouldn't be necessary...

*LHT 幽香 邪悪
