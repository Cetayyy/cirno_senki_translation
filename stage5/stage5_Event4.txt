As expected of a celestial. It’s quite impressive to accomplish such a thing effortlessly...

*LHT 芳香 笑
Master Seiga. That was amazing ! The rocks came out like “kaboom" !

*RHT 青娥 笑
Hehe, indeed. I also need to do my best.
*RHT 青娥
I went through the trouble of making this talisman. I think it is time to use it now.

*LHT 芳香 笑
A cure-all medicine talisman ?

*RHT 青娥 笑
Something like that, yes.

*KON びょわわーん
*RHT 青娥
それっ！

...Oh. I thought they were defeated, but it looks like they can still keep going.
They're more robust than I thought.

*LHT 衣玖 哀
...Really ? It looks more like they were brought back to life against their will...

*RHT 天子 哀
Come on, that's impossible. You can't bring back people to life like that.
They were probably still fine.

*LHT 衣玖 驚
M-Maybe...
*LHT 衣玖
That would be weird, indeed...

H-Hey, Misty. This is...

*RHT ミスティア 驚
No way... We definitely beat those people already...
*RHT ミスティア 哀
Wriggle, what's the meaning of this ?

*LHT リグル 驚
I-I don't know...

*RHT 文 驚
Is this also that celestial's power...? No, maybe it's from that other person...

*LHT チルノ 怒
No matter how many times they come back, nothing will change ! We just have to beat them again !
