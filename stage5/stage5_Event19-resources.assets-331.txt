Oh, it’s a kappa this time.

*LHT にとり
Ah, good timing.
Hey, miss. Haven you seen a serious-looking white wolf tengu around here ?

*RHT 衣玖 笑
Aah, I did see a person like this. She came here just earlier.
*RHT 衣玖
After explaining to her what we are doing here, she understood and went back home.

*LHT にとり 哀
I see... Hmm, so it turned into a misunderstanding. Can't be helped, then.
*LHT にとり 笑
Alright, thank you.

*RHT 衣玖 笑
It's nothing.

*LHT にとり
Well then, in that case, I should head back home.
*LHT にとり 驚
...H-Huh ? The marine propulsion machine doesn’t move ? Could it be a battery issue ??

*RHT 衣玖
What’s the matter ?

*LHT にとり 哀
Oh... It's nothing... It’s just that the machine has run out of battery.
*LHT にとり
Oh well. I’ll just head home by swimming.

*RHT 衣玖
Does it need electricity, by any chance ?

*LHT にとり
Hm ? Yes, but...

*RHT 衣玖 笑
Then I might be able to help. Can you lend me the machine for a moment ?

*LHT にとり 驚
Eh...? You can produce electricity ?
*LHT にとり 笑
That’s amazing ! Can I ask you a favor !? Is it possible for you to recharge it here...

*RHT 衣玖 笑
Here, you say ? Understood. Yaaah !

 That was a bit reckless...
*LHT にとり
Let’s see... Oh, amazing ! It moves !
*LHT にとり 笑
ou got me out of a sticky situation ! Thank you so much !
