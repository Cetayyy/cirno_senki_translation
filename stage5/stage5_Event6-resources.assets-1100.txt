This power to manipulate the earth is wonderful. Truly the secret arts of a celestial.
I can’t compete with her, for sure... But I must try my best to show what I can do as well.
*RHT 青娥 笑
I wouldn’t meet her expectations if I don’t.

Eeh ? Wait, how can they still stand !?

Ew... Their arms are bent weirdly...

Oh, wow. Were those guys always this determined ?

*LHT 衣玖 哀
This is surprising. Even on the verge of death, they come back with sheer determination.

*RHT 天子 哀
I wonder if putting our trust in them allowed them to fight even more.

*LHT 衣玖
Hmm, maybe.
*LHT 衣玖 笑
Eldest daughter, how about you offer them some words of encouragement ?

*RHT 天子 哀
...N-No, I'm not comfortable doing that. They're creeping me out a little.

*LHT 衣玖 哀
Me too. They look... like zombies. What on earth is happening here ?

*RHT 天子 怒
That's what I want to know !
