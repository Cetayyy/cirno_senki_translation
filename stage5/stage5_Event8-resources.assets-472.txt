It's taking more time than I thought... I guess I'll have to send my corpse soldiers after all.

;;とは言え、ここからあの妖精達の所は遠いし、[r]辿り着くには時間が……
*RHT 青娥 驚
Oh, I have an idea. I won't even have to make them walk around the lake.
*RHT 青娥 笑
Well then, time to send those fairies a little present...
*RHT 青娥
There.

H-Huh ? Something is coming out of the lake !!

*RHT 文 哀
Wow. The kappas would be jealous.

*LHT 幽香
Mmh... This is certainly not that celestial's doing.

*RHT チルノ 怒
Hmph ! This isn't gonna stop us !

*LHT 大妖精 哀
Cirno, are you okay ?
*RHT チルノ 笑
Of course I am !

*LHT レティ 哀
That said, there is no end to it if we just knock them down.
We have to aim for the people controlling them.

*LHT 幽香
I agree. It would be a pain to focus on the small ones. We need to attack this celestia directly.

*RHT チルノ
I see ! Sounds good !

*LHT 大妖精 驚
Y-Yeah... I hope it won't be too dangerous.

*CHT サニー
Dai, are you scared ?

*LHT 大妖精 苦

Don't worry, Dai. We'll stay with you.
Cirno and the others can go and defeat that celestial.

*CHT ルナ 笑
Yeah. We'll protect you, Dai.

*LHT 大妖精 哀
But what if someone gets hurt...

*CHT スター 笑
It's okay. We're all in this together. Don't let that bother you.

*LHT 大妖精 哀
O-Okay...

Dai...
*RHT チルノ 苦
Hmm... What should I do...

*LHT レティ
The choice is yours, Cirno.
Should we go for Tenshi herself, or beat the ennemies around before proceeding.
It's up to you.
