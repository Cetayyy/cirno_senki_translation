Ugh, rocks again...?

*RHT チルノ 哀
What ? It's the same trick again. Boring !

*LHT ヤマメ 驚
"Boring"...? Is this your basis for making a judgement ?

*RHT パルスィ
I don't think she has any form of judgement at all...

*LHT キスメ 怒

When it comes to me, I can easily manipulate the entire planet !

*RHT 天子
That's fine. I'm just making this fight a little bit interesting.

Shall we destroy those troublesome rocks quick ?
