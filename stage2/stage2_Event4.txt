Lady Hieda !

*RHT 阿弥 驚
Reinforcements...!?
*RHT 阿弥 笑
Thank you so much ! We're saved !
*RHT 阿弥 怒
However, please be careful. Even if they're few, these youkais...

*LHT 僧兵青
Yes. Lady Hieda, please, show us the way to cross swords with those youkais. Please...!

*RHT 阿弥 怒
Okay, leave this to me !

*LHT ミスティア
Hey, Wriggle. What do they mean by a "way to cross swords" with us ?

*RHT リグル 哀
I don't know, but... This person looks like she knows about us...

*LHT ルーミア
Huh ? Wriggle, did you get to know this human ?

*RHT リグル 驚
No, not at all !
*RHT リグル 哀
But... It's as if she knows about our powers...

*LHT ミスティア 笑
No, there's now way, I've never seen her in my life.
Wriggle, it's good to be careful, but you're overthinking this.

*RHT リグル 哀
I hope so...

*RHT 阿弥 ジト目
First of all, that insect youkai. She is fast and has a solid defense. She can be a tough opponent.
*RHT 阿弥 怒
She seems to be relatively weak to magic. We should try to slow her down with poison or paralysis.

*LHT リグル 驚
Huh...?

*NLH

*RHT 阿弥 ジト目
Next, we have this one who looks like a bird.
She also benefits from her speed, but also has great mobility. Fortunately, she also has many weak points.
*RHT 阿弥 笑
Fire and ice magic will easily deal with her.

*LHT ミスティア 怒
D-did she just say "easily" !?

*NLH

*RHT 阿弥 ジト目
And then, this small youkai with blonde hair. She looks like a human, but she is a youkai of darkness.
*RHT 阿弥
She doesn't seem to have a specific weakness, sadly.
*RHT 阿弥 怒
However, since she is covered by darkness, I recommend the use of ranged attacks.

*LHT ルーミア
Huh ? How can she be so precise ?
*LHT ルーミア 笑
Looks like she knows more about me than I do.

*RHT ミスティア 怒
How !? What is the meaning of this !?
*RHT ミスティア 哀
Hey, Wriggle !

*LHT リグル 哀
Even if you ask me...

*NLH

*RHT 阿弥 笑
As for the rest, there's no need to explain.
*RHT 阿弥
Against the underground youkais, be careful about poison, confusion and stun. That's all.

*LHT 僧兵青
Understood ! By the way, what should we do with the fairies wandering around everywhere ?

*RHT 阿弥 驚
Oh ? The fairies ?
*RHT 阿弥 哀
Hmm, that's right...
*RHT 阿弥 笑
S-since they're easily defeated, you can win with simple brute force.

*LHT 僧兵青
Roger !
Alright everyone ! Now that we know how to deal with them, we should have nothing to fear !
All of you, chaaaaarge !

*RHT 僧兵黄
Yeah ! Chaaaarge !!

*MVG チルノ

*LHT チルノ 怒
Grrr ! What do you mean, "easily defeated" !?

*RHT ミスティア 怒
Right, right ! Hmph, I won't have any problems as long as I'm not hit with fire or ice !
Cirno, let's go ! Let's defeat them before they defeat us !
*RHT ミスティア 笑
Wriggle, back us up, please !

*NRH

*LHT リグル 驚
Eh ? Wait, Misty !

*RHT チルノ 怒
Hey, Misty ! The leader is me ! 
*RHT チルノ 笑
So, let's chaaaarge !!

*NRH

*RHT ルーミア 笑
I'll back up Misty too ! I'll do my best !

*NRH

*LHT リグル 驚
W-wait ! You can't back someone up on the first line !
*LHT リグル
Dai, we should go too !

*RHT 大妖精 笑
Y-yes !
*RHT 大妖精 哀
Sunny, Luna, Star ! Please, help us out !

*LHT サニー
Good grief... It's not easy to take care of those simple idiots.
