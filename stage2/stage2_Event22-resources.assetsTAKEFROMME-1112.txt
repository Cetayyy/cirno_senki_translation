*RHT ヤマメ
Thank you. I don't know who you are, but I appreciate the help.

*LHT チルノ 笑
Hehehe ~ I'm here now, so you don't need to worry !

*RHT ヤマメ 笑
Ahaha, you're quite confident. It's encouraging.
*RHT ヤマメ
But are you going to be okay ? These humans aren't messing around.
Or do you have a strategy ?

*LHT チルノ 哀
... A strategy ?
*LHT チルノ 笑
Not at all ! I'll only charge at them, no matter what !
There can be a hundred of them, I would still be on the first line !

*RHT ヤマメ 驚
(Leaving the youkais over there aside, can this powerless fairy really help us ?)

*LHT チルノ 哀
What are you making that face ?
*LHT チルノ 怒
Are you doubting my powers !?

*RHT ヤマメ 笑
N-no, it's not that. You seem very confident about your abilities. I'll give you that.
*RHT ヤマメ
Don't worry, I'm counting on you. Besides, I like the simple idea to "charge at them".
*RHT ヤマメ 笑
Well, shall we go, miss fairy ? I'm counting on you.

*LHT チルノ 笑
Hehehe ~ I’m gonna show you my powers !

Parsee... It looks like this fairy is going to help us, as expected !

*RHT パルスィ
I don't know their real intentions, though...

*LHT キスメ 哀
You're thinking too much, Parsee.
*LHT キスメ 笑
Alright, now that we are more numerous, it's time for a counterattack !
